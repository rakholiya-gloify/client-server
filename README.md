# client-server

Introduction
In this client-server project, a client can request a file or a set of files from the server. The
server searches for the file/s in its file directory rooted at its ~ and returns the file/files
requested to the client (or an appropriate message otherwise). Multiple clients can connect
to the server from different machines and can request file/s as per the commands listed in
section 2

- The server, the mirror and the client processes must run on different machines and
must communicate using sockets only.


Section 1 (Server)
- The server and an identical copy of the server called the mirror [see section 3] must
both run before any of the client (s) run and both of them must wait for request/s
from client/s
- Upon receiving a connection request from a client, the server forks a child process
that services the client request exclusively in a function called pclientrequest() and
(the server) returns to listening to requests from other clients.
- The pclientrequest() function enters an infinite loop waiting for the client to
send a command
- Upon the receipt of a command from the client, pclientrequest() performs the
action required to process the command as per the requirements listed in
section 2 and returns the result to the client
- Upon the receipt of quitc from the client, pclientrequest() exits.
- Note: for each client request, the server must fork a separate process with the
pclientrequest() function to service the request and then go back to listening to
requests from other clients


Section 2 (Client)
The client process runs an infinite loop waiting for the user to enter one of the commands.
Note: The commands are not Linux commands and are defined(in this project) to denote the
action to be performed by the server.
Once the command is entered, the client verifies the syntax of the command and if it is okay,
sends the command to the server, else it prints an appropriate error message.
List of Client Commands:
- getfn filename
o If the file filename is found in its file directory tree rooted at ~, the server must
return the filename, size(in bytes), date created and file permissions to the
client and the client prints the received information on its terminal.
- Note: if the file with the same name exists in multiple folders in the
directory tree rooted at ~, the server sends information pertaining to
the first successful search/match of filename
- Else the client prints “File not found”
- Ex: Client$ getfs sample.txt

- getfz size1 size2
- The server must return to the client temp.tar.gz that contains all the files in
the directory tree rooted at its ~ whose file-size in bytes is >=size1 and <=size2
- size1 < = size2 (size1>= 0 and size2>=0)
- If none of the files of the specified size are present, the server sends “No file
found” to the client (which is then printed on the client terminal by the client)
- Ex: Client$ getfz 1240 12450

- getft <extension list> //up to 3 different file types
- the server must return temp.tar.gz that contains all the files in its directory tree
rooted at ~ belonging to the file type/s listed in the extension list, else the
server sends the message “No file found” to the client (which is printed on the
client terminal by the client)
- The extension list must have at least one file type and can have up to 3
different file types
- Ex: Client$ getft c txt
- Client$ getft jpg bmp pdf

- getfdb date
- The server must return to the client temp.tar.gz that contains all the files in the
directory tree rooted at ~ whose date of creation is <=date
- Ex: Client$ getfdb 2023-01-01

- getfda date
- The server must return to the client temp.tar.gz that contains all the files in the
directory tree rooted at ~ whose date of creation is >=date
- Ex: Client$ getfda 2023-03-31
- quitc The command is transferred to the server and the client process is terminated
Note: All files returned from the server must be stored in a folder named f23project in the
home directory of the client.
Note:
- It is the responsibility of the client process to verify the syntax of the command
entered by the user (as per the rules in Section 3) before processing it.
- Appropriate messages must be printed when the syntax of the command is
incorrect.


Section 3 
Alternating Between the Server and the Mirror
- The server and the mirror (the server’s copy possibly with a few
additions/changes) are to run on two different machines/terminals.
- The first 4 client connections are to be handled by the server.
- The next 4 client connections are to be handled by the mirror.
- The remaining client connections are to be handled by the server and the
mirror in an alternating manner- (ex: connection 9 is to be handled by the
server, connection 10 by the mirror, and so on)
